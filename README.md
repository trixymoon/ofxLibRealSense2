# ofxLibRealSense2
librealsense 2.x addon for openFrameworks.  
This addon is for RS2 devices (D415, D435, SR300).  
Please refer to https://github.com/shiyamon/ofxLibRealSense for older devices.  

My implementation is very limited for now.  
You can only grab Color, IR, Depth buffers from RS2 devices.
